%% "author year" style.

%% If you are preparing content for an event

%% Uncommenting

%% The "title" command has an optional parameter,
%% allowing the author to define a "short title" to be used in page headers.
\title{No-Fuss Compiler Fuzzing}

%%
%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.
%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.



%%
%% By default, the full list of authors will be used in the page
%% headers. Often, this list is too long, and will overlap
%% other information printed in the page headers. This command allows
%% the author to define a more concise list
%% of authors' names for this purpose.
